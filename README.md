# BinMerger
Merges all of your .bin/.cue images in a specific folder (and all subdirs) so there is a solo .bin with the .cue file instead of multiple bin files.
Goes thru all subdirectories for you. Will delete the old files automagically.

Uses https://github.com/putnam/binmerge to do the actual work.

The reason this program exists is because Analogue Pocket core for Pc-Engine CD has a restriction of maximum amount of .bin files per .cue game. So this is to go thru ones collection of Pc-Engine games and "fix" them for the Analogue Pocket. You can find the core here: https://github.com/Mazamars312/openfpga-pcengine-cd

Use https://github.com/neil-morrison44/openfpga-instance-packager to go thru your analogue pocket sd card and "prepare" the cd games for the Pc-Engine CD core.
