# BinMerger
Merges all .bin/.cue files so there is a solo .bin with the .cue file instead of multiple bin files.
Goes thru all subdirectories for you. Deletes the old files.

Uses https://github.com/putnam/binmerge to do the actual work.

The reason this program exists is because Analogue Pocket core for Pc-Engine CD has a restriction of maximum amount of .bin files per .cue game. So this is to go thru ones collection of Pc-Engine games and "fix" them for the Analogue Pocket. You can find the core here: https://github.com/Mazamars312/openfpga-pcengine-cd
